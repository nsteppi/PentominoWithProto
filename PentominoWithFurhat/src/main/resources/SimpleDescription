This Game is called Pentomino.
We will use the pieces from the left board, to build the shape on the right board.
Please describe the pieces one at the time.
You can refer to the piece's color, position on the grid or by comparing the shape to a letter.
We need to move each piece to the correct position on the figure.
To move a piece, specify the direction and tell me when to stop.
You might need to rotate or mirror the pieces to make them fit.
